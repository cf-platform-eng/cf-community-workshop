= CF Workshop Continuous Delivery Lab
Matt Stine <matt.stine@gmail.com>

== Intro

This lab will guide you through building a BASIC continuous delivery pipeline using Jenkins, Artifactory, and Cloud Foundry.

== Setup Steps

. FORK (using the GitHub UI) and clone the [citytest repo](https://github.com/mstine/citytest):
+
[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GIT_USERNAME>/citytest
$ cd citytest
----

. Login to your Jenkins instance at CloudBees.

. Navigate to +Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Available+.

. Install the following plugins:
+
* Gradle
* Mask Passwords
* Extensible Choice Parameter Plugin
* Artifactory Plugin
* Parameterized Trigger Plugin
* Artifact Resolver
+
When you do, tell Jenkins to restart after plugin install.

. Login to your Aritfactory Online instance.

. Navigate to +Admin > Security > General+.

. Activate encryption for passwords.

. Next navigate to +Admin > Security > Users+.

. Create a new user named +deployer+ with a password of your choosing.

. Once created, navigate to +Admin > Security > Permissions+.

. +Edit+ the +Anything+ permissions target.

. Select the +Users+ tab, and check all permissions for your new user.

. Logout, and then log back in as your new user.

. Click on the account name in the top right hand corner of the screen.

. Enter your password and click +Unlock+.

. Copy your encrypted password and paste it somewhere safe.

. Next, go back to Jenkins. And navigate to +Manage Jenkins > Configure System+.

. Find Artifactory, and add a new Artifactory server:
+
URL:: `https://<<your artifactory hostname>>.artifactoryonline.com/<<your artifactory hostname>>` (e.g. +https://mattstine.artifactoryonline.com/mattstine+)
Username:: the user you created in artifactory
Password:: the encrypted password you copied a moment ago

. Click +Apply+. Then click +Test Connection+ and ensure things are working.

. Next, find the Artifact Resolver section.

. In the Repositories section set the following properties:
+
Repo Id:: Artifactory
Repo Type:: default
Repo Manager:: checked
Url:: `https://<<your artifactory hostname>>.artifactoryonline.com/<<your artifactory hostname>>` (e.g. +https://mattstine.artifactoryonline.com/mattstine+)
Username:: the user you created in artifactory
Password:: the encrypted password you copied a moment ago

. Click +Apply+.

== Create the Initial Build Job

. Navigate back to Jenkins Home.

. Click +New Job+, give it the name +citytest+ and select ``Build a free-style software project.'' Then click +OK+.

. Under +Source Code Management+, select +Git+, and supply your repository URL (e.g. `https://github.com/<YOUR_GIT_USERNAME>/citytest`).

. Under +Build Triggers+, select +Poll SCM+ and provide the string +* * * * *+.

. Under +Build Environment+, select +Gradle-Artifactory Integration+.
+
* Select your Artifactory server.
* Select +libs-releases_local+ as the +Publishing Respoitory+.
* Ensure the following are checked:
** Capture and publish build info
** Allow promotion of non-staged builds
** Publish artifacts to Artifactory
** Publish Ivy descriptors

. Under +Build+, add a +Invoke Gradle Script+ build step.
+
Gradle Version:: gradle-latest
Build Step Description:: +build environment agnostic artifact+
Switches:: +-Pbuildversion=$BUILD_NUMBER+
Tasks:: +clean assemble+

. Save the config and try running the build by clicking ``Build Now''. Ensure that you see the artifact in Artifactory.

== Create the Deploy Job

. Navigate back to Jenkins Home.

. Click +New Job+, give it the name +citytest-deploy+ and select ``Build a free-style software project.'' Then click +OK+.

. Check +This build is parameterized+.

. Click +Add Parameter+ and choose +Extensible Choice+.
+
Name:: +BUILD_VERSION+
Description:: +The citytest build to promote.+
Choice Provider:: +System Groovy Choice Parameter+
Groovy System Script::
+
[source,groovy]
----
import jenkins.model.*
import hudson.model.*

def getAllBuildNumbers(Job job) {
  def buildNumbers = []
  (job.getBuilds()).each { build ->
    buildNumbers.add(build.getDisplayName().substring(1))
  }
  return buildNumbers
}

def buildJob = Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName('citytest');
return getAllBuildNumbers(buildJob)
----

. Under +Build Environment+, check +Mask Passwords+, then Add:
+
Name:: +CF_PASSWORD+
Password:: Your Pivotal Web Services Password

. Under +Build+, add an +Artifact Resolver+ build step:
Fail on error:: checked
Target directory:: artifacts
Release update policy:: always
Snapshot update policy:: always
Then under Artifacts:
Artifact Id:: citytest
Version:: ${BUILD_VERSION}
Extension:: jar

. Under +Build+, add a +Execute Shell+ build step. Replace in the script below +uniquetoken+ with something like your username!
+
Command::
+
[source,bash]

UNAMESTR=`uname`

----

. Save the config and try running the build by clicking ``Build With Parameters''. Select the build you created in the previous step from the drop list. You should see the build deploy to Cloud Foundry.

== Create the Trigger

. Return to the +citytest+ project and click +Configure+.

. Under +Post Build Actions+ add a post-build action, selecting +Trigger parameterized build on other projects+.
+
Projects to build:: +citytest-deploy+
Predefined parameters:: +BUILD_VERSION=$BUILD_NUMBER+

. Save the config and try running the build by clicking ``Build Now''. You should see both builds executed coupled with a zero-downtime deploy of the app to Cloud Foundry.

== Make a Commit and Watch the Pipeline Run

. In your local clone of the +cities+ project, open +src/main/java/org/example/cities/VersionController.java+ in an editor.

. Change the version number in the string.

. Execute +git commit -am "change version number"+.

. Execute +git push origin master+.

. You should see both builds executed coupled with a zero-downtime deploy of the app to Cloud Foundry!

. Congrats! You've reached the end of the lab.
